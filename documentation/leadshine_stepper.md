# Leadshine EtherCAT Stepper Drivers

The `lcec_leadshine_stepper` driver supports a number of
[Leadshine](http://www.leadshine.com) EtherCAT stepper
drives.

## Setup

In your XML file, you should have an entry somewhat like this:

```xml
<masters>
  <master idx="0" appTimePeriod="2000000" refClockSyncCycles="1000">
    ...
    <slave idx="1" type="2CS3E-D507" name="x-axis"/>
	...
  </master>
</masters>
```

See the [CiA 402](cia402.md) documentation for additional details
about how to configure CiA 402 devices in LinuxCNC.  At a minimum, you
will need to include the `cia402` HAL component.

## Devices

This driver includes settings for most known Leadshine open- and
closed-loop EtherCAT stepper drives as of early 2024.  Unfortunately,
Leadshine's websites and EtherCAT ESI config files differ on some
details (including product names!), so not every device that *could*
be supported is currently implemented.

Leadshine has a number of very similar models on their website, and
sometimes also lists the same device in different locations with
slightly different names; the 2CS3E-D507 is sometimes referred to as
the 2CL3-EC507, for instance.

There are a number of devices on their website that would probably
work if we had their EtherCAT ID numbers, including the CS3E-D503B,
CS3E-D507B, EM3E-522B, EM3E-556B, EM3E-870B, and DM3C-EC882AC.

Only the 2CS3E-D507 has been tested at this point.

### Caveats

- Only the 2CS3E-D507 has been tested.
- It appears that some Leadshine devices measure peak current in units
  of 100mA and other in units of 1mA.  Right now, it looks like
  closed-loop devices use 100mA and open-loop devices use 1mA, but
  this may not be universally correct.  See object 0x2000:0 in the
  device manual and file a bug if your device doesn't match this
  pattern.
- A number of useful device-specific `<modParams>` aren't directly
  supported yet.
- Digital input controls aren't complete yet.  The 2CS3E series, at
  least, doesn't *quite* seem to follow the CiA 402 spec.  It puts
  GPIO pins at 0x60fd:0 bits 4-7, while the spec says that bits 4-15
  are reserved.  Also, the controls for mapping hardware input pins to
  logical pins seem to require a save followed by a restart of the
  device in order to take effect, which is awkward in a
  `<modParam>`. See Leadshine's documentation for details on how to
  change pin function for now.

## Configuration

This driver takes a number of `<modParam>` options that control its
operation.  There are a few Leadshine-specific parameters, plus a
number of additional [`cia402` modParams](cia402.md).

The parameters are listed in their single-axis form; dual-axis devices
have two sets of these parameters, one starting with `ch1` and one
starting with `ch2`.  For example, `ch1peakCurrent_amps` and
`ch2peakCurrent_amps`.

<dl>
<dt>&lt;modParam name="feedRatio" value="10000"/&gt;</dt>
<dd>The number of microsteps per rotation.  This can be provided as a floating-point number or an integer ratio (`10000/6`).</dd>

<dt>&lt;modParam name="encoderRatio" value="4000"/&gt;</dt>
<dd>The number of encoder steps per rotation.  Only applicable to closed-loop steppers.  Can be a floating point number or an integer ratio.</dd>

<dt>&lt;modParam name="peakCurrent_amps" value="3.0"/&gt</dt>
<dd>Set the maximum current for the motor, in amps.</dd>

<dt>&lt;modParam name="controlMode"  value="openloop|closedloop"/&gt</dt>
<dd>Set the control mode for the motor.  </dd>

</dl>

## Inputs

To use digital inputs, you will most likely need to manually make
configuration changes to your stepper drive using `ethercat download`
on the command line.  Unfortunately, Leadshine only re-reads digital
input configuration on reboot, so it's not really useful to configure
this via `<modParam>`, like other drivers currently do.

Also, the exact commands needed depend on the Leadshine model that
you're using.  Various models have between 4 and 7 inputs with
somewhat different capabilities.

To start, please find your device's manual.  Leadshine has PDF
available at
https://www.leadshine.com/networks/fieldbus/EtherCAT.html.

I'm going to use the 2CS3E-D507, because that's what I have, and it's
slightly more complex than most devices.  In the manual, in the "I/O
Configuration Object" section, there are 2 tables that we'll need:

- Input Ports Function Value
- 0x60FD Corresponding Function Table

The first table shows the defaults for each port, as well as which
SDOs control each.  Generally, input 1 on a single-axis device is at
0x2152:01, input 2 is at :02, and so on.  For dual axis devices, use
0x2952 instead of 0x2152.

For the 2CS3E-D507, the input port function value table says that
input 1 defaults to "touch probe 1", which is 0x17.  Looking in the
other table, we can see that 0x17 is, indeed "Probe 1".

For the 2CS3E, there are 7 valid functions listed:

- probe1 (0x17)
- probe2 (0x18)
- home (0x16)
- positive limit (0x01)
- negative limit (0x02)
- quick stop (0x14)
- GPIO (0x19).

All of these *except* GPIO have special meanings in specific contexts.
For instance, home and the two limit switches can be used in CiA
402-native homing.

You *should* be able to still read from these inputs if they're in
their default config, but the hardware reports their status
differently, so we've given them different HAL pin names.

- probe1 -> `srv-din-probe1`
- probe2 -> `srv-din-probe2`
- home -> `srv-din-home`
- positive limit -> `srv-din-positive-limit`
- negative limit -> `srv-din-negative-limit`
- quick stop -> `srv-din-quick-stop`

When pins are configured as GPIO, they get simple numeric names:

- Input 1 -> `srv-din-1`
- Input 2 -> `srv-din-2`

and so on.

To, to change input 1 from its default (probe1) to GPIO, you'll need
to run these commands on the command line.  Replace XX and YY with the
master and slave address for your Leadshine device; see `ethercat
slaves` for a list.

```
$ ethercat download -m XX -p YY 0x2152 0x01 0x19
```

If you want to change more than one port, do those next.  Then run the
following command to save these settings as the new startup defaults:

```
$ ethercat download -m XX -p YY 0x1010 0x01 0x65766173
```

Once this is complete, you'll need to power-cycle the stepper drive for the
new configs to take effect.  You can verify the new config after
reboot by running:

```
$ ethercat upload -m XX -p YY 0x2152 0x01
```

This should return 0x19, which is what we set above.  If the save
failed, then we'll probably get 0x17 back instead.

## Outputs
