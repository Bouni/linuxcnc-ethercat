# How to contribute

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to
us](https://github.com/linuxcnc-ethercat/linuxcnc-ethercat/pull/new/master)
with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull
requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a
pull request, we will love you forever if you include RSpec
examples. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our
coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are
atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages
are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding and Formatting Conventions

Right now, the code is somewhat inconsistent about formatting.  We've
[discussed](https://github.com/linuxcnc-ethercat/linuxcnc-ethercat/issues/3)
adding (and possibly enforcing) a standard formatting/indentation
standard, but aren't ready to enforce it (or manage the multi-thousand
line PR that it'd cause, or the merge headaches that would fall out
from that).

At the moment, consider using
[`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) on new
or heavily modified code, using the style included in `.clang-format`
in the root of the LinuxCNC-Ethercat directory.  This is a lightly
modified version of Google's standard format, and comes fairly close
to matching most of the existing code.
